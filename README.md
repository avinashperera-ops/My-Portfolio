# My Interactive Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio site! This project is a creative, interactive web experience featuring a 3D cube you can control with arrow keys, built with React and Three.js. It’s hosted on [Vercel](https://my-portfolio.vercel.app) and showcases my skills as a developer with a playful twist, inspired by sites like [Bruno Simon’s portfolio](https://bruno-simon.com/).

## Features
- **Interactive 3D Cube**: Move it around using arrow keys in a starry 3D environment.
- **Portfolio Section**: Details about me, my projects, and contact info.
- **Responsive Design**: Works across devices with a sleek, dark theme.
- **Deployed on Vercel**: Fast, scalable hosting with easy updates.

## Tech Stack
